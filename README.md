# Hydroper© Scripting

Hydroper© Scripting is an integrated development environment featuring new user interface skins.

## Work in progress

Hydroper© Scripting is not done and is uninitiated in the present. Do not take it seriously, but I may work in the project anytime.

Right now:

* [ ] Trying to finish context menus for the user interface, but they have the following bugs currently:
  * Actions only work when clicked with Enter
  * Actions do not work when clicking with the device pointer
  * Click on a list item closes the context menu modal

Basics:

* [ ] Workspaces
* [ ] Version control
* [ ] Tabs
  * [ ] Continuously recover unsaved tabs
  * [ ] Code area
* [ ] Settings
* [ ] Extensions
* [ ] Cloud synchronization

Special cases:

* [ ] When two tabs have are files with the same filename, automatically split the editor for the respective directories.

## Building
